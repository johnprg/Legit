"North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory (R) announced he would be suing the Obama administration for stopping his state s ability to discriminate against transgender people. Attorney General Loretta Lynch just hit him back. Hard.In a press conference scheduled just hours after McCrory decided he would order millions of dollars to be wasted fighting a hopeless battle to prevent trans people from using public bathrooms in North Carolina, Lynch spoke firmly about the rights of all people to be allowed to enjoy public spaces free of harassment or bans.Lynch carefully, and forcefully, demolished the  state-sponsored discrimination  inherent in the  bathroom bill  known as HB 2. The law, she said, is patently illegal and the Department of Justice would continue opposing it, despite the lawsuit.In a spine tingling moment, she spoke directly to the trans community in North Carolina and across the country who have watched in horror as Republican officials have legalized their persecution. She said that her colleagues at the Department of Justice and the Obama administration have their backs and would fight for them every step of the way. We see you. We stand with you, and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward. And please know that history is on your side. Lynch also has very powerful personal reasons to abhor what is happening in North Carolina   she was born there. She also grew up in a time when North Carolina was known for other forms of discrimination. She reminded America that not too long ago, people on the wrong side of history put signs over bathrooms saying African Americans could not enter. Even as things change, things stay the same.AG Lynch to transgender community.  We see you, we stand with you, and we will do everything we can to protect you.  https://t.co/fYLR8AlcNR  ABC News (@ABC) May 9, 2016In her statement, Lynch also reminded North Carolina that very soon they will have more than just millions of dollars in lost revenue from boycotts to worry about. Being found in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws would mean the state could lose federal funding for things like the Department of Public Safety and the state s public university system. In rushing to harass trans people, state Republicans have not only sliced off their nose to spite their face, they are cutting themselves to pieces limb by limb. It s not pretty.Lynch s powerful defense of the LGBT community serves as a stunningly clear example of how far apart the two major political parties has grown in the last decade. The Obama administration has made it clear that the LGBT community will not be victimized on his watch. On the other hand, many of the Republican candidates for president just weeks ago were running on the premise that transgender individuals were nothing more than sexual predators dressed up as women as a way to gain access to women s bathrooms. Indeed, that appears to be the entire premise of North Carolina s  bathroom bill.  No actual instances of sexual assaults on women or girls from trans women has ever been recorded. The problem simply does not exist.Watch Loretta Lynch lay down the law below:Featured image via CNN screengrab",Fake
"John and Melissa Wood are typical right-wing loons. After their daughter told them about her class assignments, John Wood set off to LaPlata High School in Maryland in a fit of rage. His daughter, it seems, was taught about Islam as part of a world history course, which didn t sit well with the bigoted former marine or his wife.According to the Woods, their daughter was forced to accept Islam as her one true religion and was forced to memorize the five tenets of the faith. They argued that the class only spent a single day on Christianity and then moved on to two weeks of Islamic training.Learning to recite things in the course of a history class is what most people would call  studying,  but the dad found it so vile that she was being forced to convert to Islam that he went to the school and threatened the faculty, resulting in an immediate ban from the property and a no trespass order from local law enforcement.While the school contends that the reality of the situation doesn t fit the narrative the bigots have concocted, the Woods have decided to sue the school with the help of the Thomas Moore Law Center, the right-wing crackpot firm that unsuccessfully argues for intelligent design and Christian indoctrination in schools on a regular basis. The center said in court filings: A school cannot achieve diversity by punishing and alienating students who hold Judeo-Christian beliefs, while bolstering the doctrines and teachings of other religions. Parents must be ever vigilant to the Islamic indoctrination of their children under the guise of teaching history and multiculturalism. This is happening in public schools across the country. And they must take action to stop it. Yeah, that s not at all what s going on. As the school explained in a statement to WTOP: The particular unit in question is on the formation of Middle Eastern empires in which students learned the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it, along with politics, culture, economics and geography, contributed to the development of the Middle East. Other religions are introduced when they influence or impact a particular historical era or geographic region. For example, when reviewing the Renaissance and Reformation, students study the concepts and role of Christianity. When learning about the development of China and India, students examine Hinduism and Buddhism It doesn t matter how you try to explain teaching Islam to right-wing imbeciles. They see all Muslims as a threat the them. They hear the word  Muslim  in a public school and their heads explode, because the 1st Amendment says no religion in public places. Now tell that teacher to lead those kids in christian prayer before it s too late for them.The most ridiculous argument the suit brings is this: The course also taught false statements such as Allah is the same God worshiped by Christians and Islam is a  religion of peace' According to these people a religion of a billion people are out to kill us all. Considering if that were true they would only have to get about 6 people each to kill all non-Muslims, you have to wonder why it hasn t happened already. You also have to wonder how people can continue to call Islam a  pagan  religion when the tribe Mohammed came from was directly descended from Ishmael, son of Abraham, considered the steward of the faith to his tribe and brother of Isaac, patriarch of Judaism.I learned that from a high school world history course.The Woods are asking for injunctive relief barring the teaching of anything that has to with Islam from school grounds and for the trespass order to be lifted. It shouldn t be long before this case, much like all of the other zealot-friendly issues brought by the Moore Center.Featured image from Wikipedia",Fake
"How long before the media is clammering all over this construction worker to get an interview with this  hero?  Yet when Ben Carson suggested victims faced with the same or similar situation react in the same way, he was called  crazy  by the media Byron Price isn t afraid of much, but, he didn t expect to come face-to-face with a determined suspect who was on a mission. Bryon was among the least injured, but, campus officials say his brave acts may have saved lives.When Bryon heard a commotion he went to see who was screaming and possibly break up a fight. When he stepped into a second-floor classroom he found the armed suspect who then turned and came after him.  So when he came at him he said he ended up on his back. I said why d you go on your back. He goes, he goes, I don t care if he cuts my legs I didn t want him to cut my chest or my abdomen. He said he has to come at me if I m down and then if he has to bend over I got a chance at his eyes or his throat  and it worked,  said John Price, victims father.Byron was stabbed while trying to fight off the attacker. His father said another construction worker also grabbed a ladder to try to threaten the suspect and get him to leave.Byron was working on remodeling a waiting room on campus. He was just finishing up his work for the day when he noticed the commotion and went to investigate. His father said his son doesn t want any attention for his actions and attempts to save others, but he is proud of how he confronted danger without a second thought.  As a man, you want to be the guy when it s your turn to rise up and do what you are supposed to do, no matter what, you do it. And then when your son s do it.

"Mexico has been the beneficiary of our open borders for decades. It s really quite amazing how loudly they cry foul when we finally have a presidential candidate willing to stand up to this insanity and say,  ENOUGH! It s Time to put Americans first! Illegal immigrants send home $50 billion annually but cost taxpayers more than $113 billion. Approximately 126,000 illegal immigrants emigrated from these three nations to the U.S. since last October and federal officials estimate at least 95,500 more will enter next year.The Central American governments have encouraged the high levels of emigration because it is earning their economy billions of dollars! For every illegal alien that sneaks into the U.S. and remits money back home, that grand total remittance number only grows. But what if the millions of U.S. jobs now filled by illegal aliens were done by American workers earning better wages, paying more in taxes and spending their money in their communities rather than sending it abroad?Americans are the ones forced to pick up the $113 billion tab for taking care of the country s 12 million illegal immigrants. Is it the responsibility of taxpaying citizens to cover the cost of illegal immigration and the government s aid to these countries while illegal workers continue to send their money overseas to send $50 billion overseas? Via: immigrationreform.comYet, somehow Donald Trump is to BLAME for wanting to shut down our open borders and bring some sanity back to our nation that is being overrun by Mexican drug runners and gang bangers coming from every corner of Mexico, Central and South America? A new Mexican movie promoted by Univision host Jorge Ramos portrays a drunk vigilante motivated by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s anti-immigrant rant killing at least four illegal immigrants at the border.The trailer for the movie, Desierto, now in Mexican theaters, blasts out Trump s initial criticism of illegal immigrants as a man armed with a rifle guns down targets crossing under barbed wire.https://youtu.be/V48ttgGqsswIt later shows the same man, in a pickup holding a bottle of what appears to be whisky, a beer can nearby, as a voice says,  Welcome to the land of the free.  The trailer ends with,  words are as dangerous as bullets. The Center for Immigration Studies on Tuesday first blogged on the  exploitation  movie and the promotion by Ramos on his Sunday show Al Punto. This material resonates powerfully with Jorge Ramos. His conviction that racism and xenophobia are the driving forces of opposition to illegal immigration is a central theme of his nightly newscasts. Ramos fixates on reports that confirm his conviction with the obsessiveness of an exploitation film director showing close-ups of bullets tearing into human flesh,  wrote CIS Fellow Jerry Kammer.He added:  On Sunday, Ramos talked with  Desierto  director Jonas Cuaron and star Gael Garcia Bernal about Trump s repugnant comments about Mexicans. Since then, Ramos said,  there are thousands if not millions of North Americans who feel that they have the absolute freedom to be racists. Via: Washington Examiner",Fake

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A record number of local tax and bond measures will fill the California ballot this November, including over $32 billion of proposed funding for education, infrastructure and homeless services. Some 650 local measures will go before voters, including 427 revenue measures. That is considerably more than the number proposed during any of the last five gubernatorial or presidential elections, according to data compiled by the local government finance consulting firm CaliforniaCityFinance.com. Previously, the most measure-packed election was in November 2014, with 268 local revenue measures. California is one of 24 states that allow initiative rights to its citizens. Voter-approved measures are used to raise revenues for specific construction projects, change tax policy, or create new laws.      In the Golden State and nationwide, a boom in bond proposals  follows years of federal cutbacks to state and local programs, continued low interest rates and years of unmet infrastructure needs. The largest monetary requests by local municipalities in California include $3.5 billion for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), $1.2 billion for Los Angeles homeless housing and services, and $950 million for affordable housing in Santa Clara County. There are 184 local measures to fund public school and community college projects, totaling more than $25 billion.  Michael Coleman, head of CaliforniaCityFinance.com, said the surge in education bond measures coincides with statewide Proposition 51, which authorizes $9 billion in general obligation bonds for public school facilities. Proposition 55 aims to increase education funding by extending upper income tax rates. “There’s a lot of folks that think this is the time to go for a new school bond,” said Coleman. “They see it as a synchronous message, and time to get in line for matching funds.” The Nov. 8 election is a focus for statewide propositions as well. There are 17 in total, regarding issues ranging from marijuana legalization to the public cost of prescription drugs, tobacco taxes and the death penalty.  The surge of ballot measures comes during an election year in which the presidential race is sure to draw large crowds to voting booths. There is also the lingering effect of low voter turnout during the November 2014 election that reduced the signature threshold for a proposition to qualify.  Across the country, 74 citizen-initiated measures fill state ballots, more than double the number certified in 2014, according to Natalie Cohen, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. Growing populist sentiment and frustration with traditional government contributed to the groundswell, Cohen wrote in a recent report about upcoming ballot measures. In California, some local measures are reactive to state propositions. For example, Proposition 64 aims to legalize recreational cannabis, and 37 local measures would create marijuana taxes for local cities and counties.  Thirteen countywide measures would fund transportation improvements. “That’s coming from an acknowledged, pent-up demand for badly needed infrastructure repairs,” Coleman said. Eighty-eight measures would increase or extend local sale taxes. Another 39 support parcel taxes for road improvements, fire and emergency services, hospitals and police. Parcel taxes are flat taxes on properties that originated after Proposition 13 severely limited property taxes in 1978.  Three Bay Area measures would tax sugary beverages. ",Real
"LILONGWE (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Monday it has pulled staff out of two districts in southern Malawi where a vampire scare has triggered mob violence in which at least five people have been killed. Belief in witchcraft is widespread in rural Malawi, one of the world s poorest countries, where many aid agencies and NGOs work. A spate of vigilante violence linked to a vampire rumors also erupted in Malawi in 2002.        These districts have severely been affected by the ongoing stories of blood sucking and possible existence of vampires,  the UN Department on Safety and Security (UNDSS) said in a security report on the Phalombe and Mulanje districts that was seen by Reuters. The Acting UN Resident Coordinator, Florence Rolle, said in an emailed response to questions that based on the report that  some UN staff have relocated while others are still in the districts depending on locations of their operations .  UNDSS is continuing to monitor the situation closely to ensure all affected UN staff are back in the field as soon as possible,  Rolle said. Rolle did not say how many workers had been relocated. The UNDSS report said at least five people had been killed in the area since mid-September by lynch mobs accusing them of vampirism. It said mobs searching for vampires have been mounting road blocks in the district, raising security concerns. Malawian President Peter Mutharika said the reports were  distressing and agonizing .    This development has been of grave concern to the President and the entire Government,  his office said in a statement. The UNDSS report said the vampirism rumors appear to have originated in neighboring Mozambique, although it was not clear what had sparked them. It recommended the  temporary suspension of U.N. activities in the area until the situation is normalized . It said some NGOs had pulled personnel from the districts and temporarily suspended their programs but did not name the organizations.  ",Real
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-led panel in the U.S. House of Representatives agreed on Tuesday to add $7 million to a short-term federal spending bill to reimburse New York authorities for President-elect Donald Trump’s security costs, far short of the $35 million requested by the city’s congressional delegation. New York’s U.S. lawmakers were quick to express their unhappiness. “I am extremely disappointed that the Continuing Resolution to fund the federal government does not fully reimburse the people of New York for the unprecedented security costs incurred to keep the President-elect and his family safe between the election and his inauguration,” U.S. Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney said in a statement. The bill, which funds U.S. agencies through April 28, must pass before a Friday deadline to keep government agencies running. At a Capitol Hill news conference earlier on Tuesday, John Miller, the New York Police Department’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counter terrorism, said he was in contact with congressional Democrats and Republicans about the costs of security operations to protect Trump both before and after the Republican takes office on Jan. 20. “This is not about party politics. It’s not about politics at all,” Miller said. He said Trump’s security “footprint” would be even “more complex” once he becomes president. Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said the Republican leadership of the House Appropriations committee had expressed sympathy for the city’s pre-inauguration reimbursement request but had asked for more specifics. Several House Democrats on Tuesday also signed a letter to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urging that the state and city “refuse to pay” for Trump’s extra New York security costs once he is sworn in as president.  “Should the President-Elect choose to maintain two permanent residences for his family, it is reasonable to request he reimburse the city and the state for all additional security expenses from his own significant personal financial resources,” the letter said. Trump has said his wife, Melania, and son Barron will move from New York to the White House “right after he finishes school.” ",Real
"PARIS (Reuters) - French president Emmanuel Macron s popularity jumped back above 50 percent thanks in part to better ratings among the young and the working class, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, confirming a rebound that started at the beginning of December. Macron s popularity dropped quickly after he swept to an electoral victory in May on a centrist platform, shattering a long-standing two-party system in France.  But while the former investment banker has struggled to shake off a  president of the rich  tag pinned on him by rivals for policies such as cuts in housing benefits, Macron s efforts to defend French interests abroad have helped lift his ratings.  His popularity rose above 50 percent for the first time since his election in early December, and a new poll on Wednesday, taken on Monday and Tuesday, showed the president scoring a 52 percent approval rating. That was a six-percentage-point jump from November, according to the BVA poll, carried out for Orange and La Tribune and released on the eve of Macron s 40th birthday.  As well as praising Macron s international efforts, those surveyed also highlighted that he was delivering on campaign promises, BVA said, even though some policies like a labor reform that gives employers greater freedom to hire and fire staff were deeply unpopular with many of his detractors.  The president is most popular with older voters and higher earners, but made the biggest progress in the latest poll with the young, BVA added.  Other surveys this week also confirmed Macron was making headway, although a ViaVoice poll for Liberation published on Tuesday put his popularity rating lower, at 46 percent. That was also a six-percentage-point improvement on the previous month.  An Odoxa survey gave Macron a 54 percent approval rating.  Macron s turnaround in polls comes as political rivals are scrambling to regroup and form a stronger opposition, at a time when both the left and right are deeply fragmented. The president s office recently played down attacks from some opponents over Macron s planned birthday celebrations with his family in the grounds of a former royal palace, which drew jibes about him being out of touch.

"UNITED NATIONS/MOSCOW/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia warned on Friday that U.S. cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base could have “extremely serious” consequences, as President Donald Trump’s first major foray into a foreign conflict opened up a rift between Moscow and Washington. The warships USS Porter and USS Ross in the Mediterranean Sea launched dozens of Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air base, which the Pentagon says was involved in a chemical weapons attack this week. (Graphic locator map on attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nm68H0)  It was Trump’s biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in January and the kind of direct intervention in Syria’s six-year-old civil war his predecessor Barack Obama avoided. The strikes were in reaction to what Washington says was a poison gas attack by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that killed at least 70 people in rebel-held territory. Syria denies it carried out the attack. They catapulted Washington into confrontation with Russia, which has advisers on the ground aiding its close ally Assad. “We strongly condemn the illegitimate actions by the U.S. The consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious,” Russia’s deputy U.N. envoy, Vladimir Safronkov, told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev charged that the U.S. strikes were one step away from clashing with Russia’s military. U.S. officials informed Russian forces ahead of the missile strikes and avoided hitting Russian personnel. (Graphic explaining kind of missile used in attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nkJYWa)           Satellite imagery suggests the base houses Russian special forces and helicopters, part of the Kremlin’s effort to help Assad fight Islamic State and other militant groups.  Trump has frequently urged improved relations with Russia, strained under Obama over Syria, Ukraine and other issues, was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday night when the attack occurred.     Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, in Florida with Trump, said on Friday the United States would announce additional sanctions on Syria in the near future but offered no specifics. Russia’s Defense Ministry responded to the attack by calling in the U.S. military attache in Moscow to say that at midnight Moscow time (5 p.m. EDT) it would close down a communications line used to avoid accidental clashes between Russian and U.S. forces in Syria, Interfax new agency said. U.S. warplanes frequently attack Islamic State militants in Syria and come close to Russian forces. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Friday the Trump administration was ready to take further steps if needed. “We are prepared to do more, but we hope that will not be necessary,” she told the U.N. Security Council. “The United States will not stand by when chemical weapons are used. It is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also was in Florida with Trump and is scheduled to go to Moscow next week, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the Russian reaction because it showed continued support for Assad. Iran, which supports Assad and has been criticized by Trump, condemned the strike, with President Hassan Rouhani saying it would bring “only destruction and danger to the region and the globe.” U.S. officials called the intervention a “one-off” intended to deter future chemical weapons attacks and not an expansion of the U.S. role in the Syrian war.  U.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support for the attack, if sometimes cautiously. The action is likely to be interpreted as a signal to Russia, and countries such as North Korea, China and Iran where Trump has faced foreign policy tests early in his presidency, of his willingness to use force. The United States is now likely to be more aggressive in pursuing intelligence about Syria’s suspected chemical weapons program. The Pentagon has also signaled interest in determining any Russian complicity. “At a minimum, the Russians failed to rein in the Syrian regime activity,” a senior U.S. military official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official also said the United States had been unable to determine if a Russian or Syrian aircraft bombed a hospital that was treating victims of the chemical attack. Russia joined the war on Assad’s behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favor. Although Moscow supports opposing sides in the war between Assad and rebels, the United States and Russia say they share a single main enemy, Islamic State. Tillerson said the strike took out about 20 percent of the seventh wing of the Syrian air force and hit a fueling facility. The base’s runway was still in use. Assad’s office said Syria would strike its enemies harder. Damascus and Moscow denied Syrian forces were behind the gas attack but Western countries dismissed their explanation that chemicals leaked from a rebel weapons depot after an air strike. The Syrian army said the U.S. attack killed six people and called it “blatant aggression” that made the United States a partner of “terrorist groups” including Islamic State. There was no independent confirmation of civilian casualties. U.S. lawmakers from both parties on Friday backed Trump’s action but demanded he spell out a broader strategy for dealing with the conflict and consult with Congress on any further action. The U.N. Security Council had been negotiating a resolution, proposed by the United States, France and Britain on Tuesday, to condemn the gas attack and push the Syrian government to cooperate with international investigators. Russia said the text was unacceptable and diplomats said it was unlikely to be put to a vote. Russia expects Tillerson to explain Washington’s stance when he visits Moscow next week, Interfax news agency cited a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman as saying. Washington has long backed rebels fighting Assad in a multi-sided civil war that has killed more than 400,000 people and driven half of Syrians from their homes since 2011. The United States has conducted air strikes against Islamic State, which controls territory in eastern and northern Syria, and a small number of U.S. troops are helping rebel militias. Asked whether the strikes set back any efforts to work with Russia to defeat Islamic State, sometimes known as ISIS, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said: “There can be a shared commitment to defeat ISIS and also agree that you can’t gas your own people.” Tuesday's attack was the first time since 2013 that Syria was accused of using sarin, a banned nerve agent it was meant to have given up under a Russian-brokered, U.N.-enforced deal that persuaded Obama to call off air strikes four years ago. (Chart of cumulated reported deaths from chemical gases in Syria - tmsnrt.rs/2o5Xbz6)  Video depicted limp bodies and children choking while rescuers tried to wash off the poison gas. Russian state television blamed rebels and did not show footage of victims.                     The U.S. strikes cheered Assad’s enemies, after months when Western powers appeared to grow increasingly resigned to his staying in power. But opposition figures said an isolated assault was far from the decisive intervention they seek. Neither the Trump administration nor its predecessor has laid out a policy aimed at ending the Syrian conflict. ",Real
